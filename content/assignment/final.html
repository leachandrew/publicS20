<ul>
<li><em>Due 8:00 PM Friday, May 8 by email</em></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="instructions">Instructions</h2>
<p><strong>Choose four (4) questions to answer</strong>. Questions draw from course lectures, discussions, and readings. Your answers, given the time and resources at your disposal, should be complete yet concise (e.g. 2-3 well-reasoned paragraphs).</p>
<p>You may discuss the questions, but you must write your own responses and turn in your own work. Answers that are substantially similar will be interpretted cheating and punished accordingly. I will not answer any questions about course content during while the exam is outstanding.</p>
<p>You will be graded both on your use of reasoning and economic analysis, and ability when relevant to accurately describe the arguments in the readings. Where asked for your opinion, you will not be graded on your <em>conclusion</em>, only your <em>reasoning.</em> You must be able to talk with some familiarity about arguments put forth in our readings, when relevant (informally, as in “According to Buchanan…”). You do not need formal citations, but it should be clear when you are referencing the readings vs. your own thinking.</p>
<p>Each question is worth <strong>25 points.</strong> This assignment is due to me by email by 8:00 PM Friday, May 8 by email. Starting at 8:01, you will lose 2 points for every hour it is late.</p>

<li><p>According to Albert Hirschman, is it better to have a monopolist with “slack” (e.g. laziness or incompetence) where all citizens are “locked-in” with no alternatives to the monopoly, or a slacking monopolist where consumers <em>do</em> have alternatives? Explain. Do you agree or disagree?</p></li>
