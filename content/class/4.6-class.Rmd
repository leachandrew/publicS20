*Online Quarantine Lecture 10*

See the [<i class="fas fa-book-reader"></i> Readings](/reading/4.6-reading) for today's topics. A reminder, **you are no longer required to read and email questions before class.** You still need to do the readings for the weekly discussion (see below), and if you choose to join the livestream, I recommend reading before class if you want me to answer any questions in real time.

# Discussion Thread

The weekly discussion thread **is posted** on Blackboard.^[Go to this course on Blackboard, and on the blue toolbar on the left, go to *Discussion Board.*] You will have until Sunday 11:59 PM to comment on this week's topics (based on lectures and readings), at which point I will evaluate your contribution for the weekly discussion grade. See my introductory post on the discussion board's thread for more information.
