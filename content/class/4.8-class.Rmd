# Discussion Thread

I have stopped grading your discussion board posts, but I will still open one for this week if you wish to share your comments, ask me or others questions, or see what everyone thinks. I'm still interested!

# Assignments

Don't forget to turn in your [/assignment/policy-paper](policy paper) by the end of this week! Your final exam will be a take-home exam, much like the midterm, posted on Monday and due by 8 PM Friday May 8.
