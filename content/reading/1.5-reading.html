<li><a href="http://justiceharvard.org/justicecourse/"><i class="fab fa-youtube"></i> Sandel, 2009, “Justice”</a> Lectures 5 (Free to Choose) and 14 (A Deal is a Deal)</li>
</ul>
<p>These are lectures from Michael Sandel’s <em>Justice</em> class at Harvard, one of the most popular courses. Due to the way these videos are cut, I encourage (but don’t require) you to watch part of the lecture immediately <em>following</em> each lecture mentioned above (e.g. lectures 6 and 15) as it continues the relevant discussions.</p>

<p>You may wish to glance at some of the Wikipedia pages on the two major books from which themes and opposing perspectives we discuss come from:</p>

<h2 id="tips-and-questions-to-read-for">Tips and Questions to Read for:</h2>
<p>The videos cover a lot of ground on different political philosophies and their consequences, but our main points we want to focus on is Rawls vs. Nozick on “social/distributive justice.”</p>
<ul>
<li><p>What is <strong>social/distributive justice</strong>? How might we define it?</p></li>
<li><p>Do you agree more with Nozick or Rawls?</p></li>
<li><p>Where are there points of tension and/or agreement between the two positions?</p></li>
<li><p>Is/how can coercive redistribution (be) just(ified)?</p></li>
<li><p>Is/how can (in)equality (be) just(ified)?</p></li>
<li><p>How do Nozick and Rawls each answer the question: what makes a distribution just or unjust?</p></li>
<li><p>What is the best way to provide for those least well off?</p></li>
</ul>
