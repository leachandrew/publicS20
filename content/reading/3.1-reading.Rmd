# Required Reading:

- <i class="fas fas fa-book"></i> Holcombe (2016), *Advanced Introduction to Public Choice*, Chs. 2,3,5

We will **not have a discussion today**, you **do not need to email questions**. This material will be a bit more dense and technical, and I will lecture for the full period. However, doing the reading will also be very helpful, even though you will not be graded on it in any way.

# Tips and Questions to Read for:

- How can we measure voters' preferences?

- What are the assumptions of the Median Voter Theorem?

- Why do political rivals often propose very similar policies? Why can't extreme candidates or Third Parties win?

- What are the major differences in electoral systems (e.g. proportional vs. plurality, parliamentary vs. presidential)?

- How might votes "cycle?"
