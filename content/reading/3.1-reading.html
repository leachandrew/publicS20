<h2 id="required-reading">Required Reading:</h2>
<ul>
<li><i class="fas fas fa-book"></i> Holcombe (2016), <em>Advanced Introduction to Public Choice</em>, Chs. 2,3,5</li>
</ul>
<p>We will <strong>not have a discussion today</strong>, you <strong>do not need to email questions</strong>. This material will be a bit more dense and technical, and I will lecture for the full period. However, doing the reading will also be very helpful, even though you will not be graded on it in any way.</p>
<h2 id="tips-and-questions-to-read-for">Tips and Questions to Read for:</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>How can we measure voters’ preferences?</p></li>
<li><p>What are the assumptions of the Median Voter Theorem?</p></li>
<li><p>Why do political rivals often propose very similar policies? Why can’t extreme candidates or Third Parties win?</p></li>
<li><p>What are the major differences in electoral systems (e.g. proportional vs. plurality, parliamentary vs. presidential)?</p></li>
<li><p>How might votes “cycle?”</p></li>
</ul>
