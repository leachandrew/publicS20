</ul>
<p>For today, after I finish up what’s left of my lecture from last Wednesday on Voting I, we will discuss the (in)famous concept of <strong>rational ignorance</strong>, as well as <strong>rational irrationality</strong>. Your reading for today is on the latter, since it is more debatable, and since I can explain the former to you very quickly in class (and give a demonstration).</p>
<p>This is a good summary of the argument made by Caplan’s similarly-titled full-length book: <em>The Myth of the Rational Voter, Why Democracies Choose Bad Policies</em>. Feel free to skim the last few sections, once you get the idea about what the biases Caplan argues are.</p>
