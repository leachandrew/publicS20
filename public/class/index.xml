      <description>Contents  Overview Slides Readings Assignments: Discussion on Wednesday Sept 11   Overview Can we plan an economy? We will cover the “socialist calculation debate” and its implications for development policy. I will lecture on Monday and part of Wednesday, and then we will hold our first discussion on Wednesday.
My lecture slides will contain a lot of quotes from participants, for a few reasons:
There is a background of ideological contestation, so I don’t want to put words in the mouths of various sides, or people I may disagree with.</description>

      <description>Contents  Overview Slides Readings Discussion Grades   Overview We begin with our approach to trying to “model” development. We begin at the micro-level and begin with the original - Adam Smith. We cover major concepts that are key tohow prosperity grows (division of labor, transition from subsistence to exchange, etc) and how markets work. In exploring markets (much in the way you would in ECON 306), we highlight the role of prices and entrepreneurship in bringing about coordination and progress - in doing so, we apply Hayek’s answer to the socialist calculation debate of the previous lesson.</description>

      <description>Contents  Overview Slides Readings Interactive Solow Model Math Appendices Cobb-Douglas Functions Growth Accounting    Overview Here we explore the famous growth models of an economy. This lesson will be the most technical of the semester, but remember there are no homeworks or exams that have you use the models to calculate equilibrium outcomes. It is more important that you understand the basic mechanisms and the major conclusions of the models.</description>

      <description>Contents  Overview Slides Readings Math Appendices   Overview This week we consider a controversial topic, the role of foreign aid in promoting economic development (growth) in developing countries. I don’t want to lecture too much, as our reading can provide much better insight, as Easterly was a central participant in this debate. I will give you an overview of the history of foreign aid and its major stages/programs (structural adjustment lending, etc.</description>

      <title>Lesson 7: Geography and Other Uncontrollable Factors - Class Notes</title>

      <description>Contents  Overview Slides Readings   Overview We come to the last key arguments for what causes some nations to become wealthy and others poor. While we cannot cover an exhaustive list of important factors (this class would be several semesters), we can cover the remaining major arguments. I will over-simplify and lump several into what we might call “geographic determinism:” countries are destined to be wealthy or poor based on their geographies.</description>

      <title>Lesson 9: The Pre-Modern Malthusian World - Class Notes</title>

      <description>Contents  Overview Slides Readings   Overview We continue our exploration of the role of economic and political institutions on economic development and economic history. We start by going back hundreds to thousands of years, to describe common institutional patterns in the pre-modern (i.e. before c.1500-1800) world. We look will examine three major themes:
First, the Malthusian trap and population dynamics of a pre-modern economy. Thomas Malthus’ famous essay about population growth outstripping natural resources is much maligned today (for failing to predict unprecedented productivity growth), but actually described the essential economics of societies for thousands of years.</description>

      <description>Contents  Overview Slides Readings   Overview This week we continue our discussion of economic history under low state capacity and discuss two aspects.
First, what were most “States” like before the modern era? We know they are unable to tax or do very much by modern standards, but it certainly was not pure anarchy. For nearly all of human history since settled agriculture, people have (at least nominally) been the subjects of an autocratThis is a catch-all term for a non-democratically-elected ruler, such as a king/queen, emperor/empress, dictator, etc.</description>
