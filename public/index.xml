      <description>Required Reading:   Hobbes (1651), Selections from The Leviathan  Machiavelli (1532), Selections from The Price  This class kicks off our look at Constitutional Political Economy, and we will examine this topic at several levels:

      <description>Required Reading:   Locke (1689), Selections from The Second Treatise on Government  Madison (1787-1788), Federalist 10 and 51  Last class was about government placing constraints on citizens, and it being in everyone’s interest to accept these. This class is about citizens placing constraints on government. We might summarize this dual dilemma by paraphrasing Madison’s Federalist 51:
 “In framing a government which is to be administered by men over men, the great difficulty lies in this: you must first enable the government to control the governed; and in the next place oblige it to control itself.</description>

      <description>Required Reading:   Buchanan and Tullock (1962), The Calculus of Consent, Chs. 3,5,6Again, you can buy several versions of this book, or here is the link to free PDF
  After we’ve digested some political philosophy (with a dose of game theory), it’s time for a more “rigorous” model of choosing as a group. How should we decide how to decide?
We read the key chapters of Buchanan and Tullock’s classic 1962 Calculus of Consent, which (mostly) launched the field of public choice as the economic analysis of politics.</description>

      <description>Contents  Appendix: Spatial Competition in Multiple-Dimensions   Appendix: Spatial Competition in Multiple-Dimensions In class, we looked at spatial competition along a single dimension, and saw that if preferences are single-peaked, the median platform will win a majority, and escape the problem of cycling.
Suppose we have three voters again voting on a platform of two issues: (1) Education Spending and (2) Defense Spending.
We represent their ideal points in 2-dimensional issue space in the figure above.</description>

Required Reading:   Posner, Eric A, and E Glen Weyl (2017), Radical Markets, Ch. 2: “Radical Democracy”  Today we discuss one of the more interesting (and radical) proposals put forth to reform politics in a fundamental (and economic) way: to dispense with “one person one vote,” allowing people to express the intensity of their preferences with (essentially) “multiple votes” that they can “buy” at an increasing cost (allowing them to make tradeoffs).</description>

Tips for Success Take notes. On paper. Really. Studies show that using pen and paper trump taking notes on a device. The main reason is because you cannot possibly write down everything I am saying by hand.</description>
