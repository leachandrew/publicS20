      <description>Required Reading:   Hobbes (1651), Selections from The Leviathan  Machiavelli (1532), Selections from The Price  This class kicks off our look at Constitutional Political Economy, and we will examine this topic at several levels:

      <description>Required Reading:   Locke (1689), Selections from The Second Treatise on Government  Madison (1787-1788), Federalist 10 and 51  Last class was about government placing constraints on citizens, and it being in everyone’s interest to accept these. This class is about citizens placing constraints on government. We might summarize this dual dilemma by paraphrasing Madison’s Federalist 51:
 “In framing a government which is to be administered by men over men, the great difficulty lies in this: you must first enable the government to control the governed; and in the next place oblige it to control itself.</description>

  After we’ve digested some political philosophy (with a dose of game theory), it’s time for a more “rigorous” model of choosing as a group. How should we decide how to decide?
We read the key chapters of Buchanan and Tullock’s classic 1962 Calculus of Consent, which (mostly) launched the field of public choice as the economic analysis of politics.</description>

      <description>Contents  Appendix: Spatial Competition in Multiple-Dimensions   Appendix: Spatial Competition in Multiple-Dimensions In class, we looked at spatial competition along a single dimension, and saw that if preferences are single-peaked, the median platform will win a majority, and escape the problem of cycling.
Suppose we have three voters again voting on a platform of two issues: (1) Education Spending and (2) Defense Spending.
We represent their ideal points in 2-dimensional issue space in the figure above.</description>

Required Reading:   Posner, Eric A, and E Glen Weyl (2017), Radical Markets, Ch. 2: “Radical Democracy”  Today we discuss one of the more interesting (and radical) proposals put forth to reform politics in a fundamental (and economic) way: to dispense with “one person one vote,” allowing people to express the intensity of their preferences with (essentially) “multiple votes” that they can “buy” at an increasing cost (allowing them to make tradeoffs).</description>

We will wrap up our “structural” look at the major political groups and institutions in American-style democracy with a look at federalism - the multiplicity of governments (federal, state, and local) each with authority over different domains of American life.
Weingast (1995) is a pretty famous paper in political economy; he uses a fairly straightforward application of the game theory of credible commitment problems to explain how a federalist system such as the United States can successfully constrain government from abusing its power.</description>

One of the benefits of federalism we saw from last class is the Tiebout competition that allows citizens to “vote with their feet,” which constrains governmental units from abusing their power or financial responsibilities. This class, we extend this idea in a much broader way, using a very famous frameowrk from a book by Albert HirschmanThe most interesting 20th Century economist you’ve never heard of.</description>

      <description>Monday, April 6, 2020
Jonathan Rauch has an interesting argument about why U.S. politics today is so divisive and ineffective: activists have reformed “corruption” out of the system too much that politicians can no longer make the necessary (and ugly) deals that good governance may require. It’s much more politically palatable to rail against corruption and propose reforms than to actually get one’s hands dirty and govern properly (via pork, logrolling, secret deals and agreements, etc).</description>

Readings:   Posner and Weyl (2017), Radical Markets, Ch.1  Following our overview of taxation, and building on a lot of concepts we’ve discussed this semesterProperty rights, externalities, the Coase Theorem, tragedy of the commons, etc.
, we can discuss another radical proposal by Posner and Weyl’s Radical Markets book.Recall the first proposal we discussed was “quadratic voting” in class 2.3

They propose a “Common Ownership Self-assessed Tax(COST)”, the essence of which is: citizens self-assess the value of their property, pay a flat tax on their self-assessed value, and the owner must sell their property at their self-assessed price if someone else is willing to pay that price.</description>

      <description>Contents  Tips for Success   Look here over the course of the semester for resources, links, and tips on how to succeed in the course, how to write well, and other things of interest related to economic development.
Tips for Success Take notes. On paper. Really. Studies show that using pen and paper trump taking notes on a device. The main reason is because you cannot possibly write down everything I am saying by hand.</description>
