      <description>Required Reading:   Hobbes (1651), Selections from The Leviathan  Machiavelli (1532), Selections from The Price  This class kicks off our look at Constitutional Political Economy, and we will examine this topic at several levels:

      <description>Required Reading:   Locke (1689), Selections from The Second Treatise on Government  Madison (1787-1788), Federalist 10 and 51  Last class was about government placing constraints on citizens, and it being in everyone’s interest to accept these. This class is about citizens placing constraints on government. We might summarize this dual dilemma by paraphrasing Madison’s Federalist 51:
 “In framing a government which is to be administered by men over men, the great difficulty lies in this: you must first enable the government to control the governed; and in the next place oblige it to control itself.</description>

      <description>Required Reading:   Buchanan and Tullock (1962), The Calculus of Consent, Chs. 3,5,6Again, you can buy several versions of this book, or here is the link to free PDF
  After we’ve digested some political philosophy (with a dose of game theory), it’s time for a more “rigorous” model of choosing as a group. How should we decide how to decide?
We read the key chapters of Buchanan and Tullock’s classic 1962 Calculus of Consent, which (mostly) launched the field of public choice as the economic analysis of politics.</description>

Required Reading:   Holcombe (2016), Advanced Introduction to Public Choice, Chs. 2,3,5  We will not have a discussion today, you do not need to email questions.

Required Reading:   Caplan (2007), “The Myth of the Rational Voter”  For today, after I finish up what’s left of my lecture from last Wednesday on Voting I, we will discuss the (in)famous concept of rational ignorance, as well as rational irrationality. Your reading for today is on the latter, since it is more debatable, and since I can explain the former to you very quickly in class (and give a demonstration).</description>

Required Reading:   Posner, Eric A, and E Glen Weyl (2017), Radical Markets, Ch. 2: “Radical Democracy”  Today we discuss one of the more interesting (and radical) proposals put forth to reform politics in a fundamental (and economic) way: to dispense with “one person one vote,” allowing people to express the intensity of their preferences with (essentially) “multiple votes” that they can “buy” at an increasing cost (allowing them to make tradeoffs).</description>
