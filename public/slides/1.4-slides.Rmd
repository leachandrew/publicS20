# The Story So Far

- Exchange is really about property rights over goods and services, (not just the goods themselves)

- Property rights can internalize externalities

- But it can be costly to create and enforce property rights

# The Free Rider Problem

.pull-left[
- Individual bears a **private cost to contribute**, but only gets a **small fraction of the (dispersed) benefit** of a good

- If individuals can gain **access** to the good (nonexcludable) **without paying**, may lead to...

- .hi[Free riding]: individuals consume the good without paying for it

# Market Failure from Public Goods

.pull-left[


- No incentive for people to contribute and pay for the good

- If enough people obtain the benefits without incurring the costs...

- **Not profitable** for private market actors to supply it

"The third and last duty of the sovereign or commonwealth is that of .hi[erecting and maintaining those public institutions and those public works], which, though they may be in the highest degree advantageous to a great society, are, however, .hi[of such a nature that the profit could never repay the expence to any individual or small number of individuals], and which it therefore .hi[cannot be expected that any individual or small number of individuals should erect or maintain]. The performance of this duty requires, too, very different degrees of expence in the different periods of society," (Book VI, Ch. 9).

# Generalizing: Collective Action Problems

.pull-left[

- .hi[Collective action problem]: situation where an individual's interest and a group's interest may conflict

- Benefits (or costs) of outcome are **nonrival** and flow to *all members* of the group

- Decisions & costs need to be incurred by individuals

- **Individual preferences** need to aggregate into a **single decision/outcome**

# Collective Action Costs I

.pull-left[

- Groups may share a **common interest**

- But **composed of individuals with their own preferences**
  - Individuals bear the personal cost of contributing
  - Individuals gain a small share of the benefits of group action

- Additionally, **transaction costs/ bargaining** to get a group to agree on decision

# Collective Action Costs II

.pull-left[

- Very hard for group action with .hi[concentrated costs and dispersed benefits]

- Easy for group action with .hi[concentrated benefits and dispersed costs]
  - Remember this idea once we start explaining public policy!

# Implications: Size and Homogeneity

.pull-left[

- **Smaller** and more **homogenous** groups face **lower** collective action costs of organizing than **larger** and more **heterogeneous** groups

# Implications: Selective Incentives

.pull-left[

- Groups often need .hi["selective incentives"] to **reward contribution** and to **punish free riding** in groups

- Positive and negative incentives
