# The Logic of Collective Action

.pull-left[

- But power and influence is not evenly distributed across interest groups 

- Olsonian logic: **Smaller** and more **homogenous** groups face **lower** collective action costs of organizing than **larger** and more **heterogeneous** groups

- Smaller groups to whom benefit (cost) of a policy is more concentrated can outmobilize larger groups where benefit (cost) is more dispersed

"In fiscal year (FY) 2013, Americans consumed 12 million tons of refined sugar, with the average price for raw sugar 6 cents per pound higher than the average world price. That means, based on 24 billion pounds of refined sugar use at a 6-cents-per-pound U.S. premium, Americans paid an unnecessary $1.4 billion extra for sugar. That is equivalent to more than $310,000 per sugar farm in the United States"

# Challenges to Good Regulation Thus Far

- Olson: collective action/free rider problem is larger for larger groups

- Rational ignorance of voters

- Caplan: voters are rationally irrational about policy
- Tullock-Stigler: it's often in the interests of industries to seek rents

- Yandle: rent-seeking can be masked by publicly noble intentions

> "What do industry and labor want from the regulators? They want protection from competition, from technological change, and from losses that threaten profits and jobs. A carefully constructed regulation can accomplish all kinds of anticompetitive goals of this sort, while giving the citizenry the impression that the only goal is to serve the public interest," (p.13).

# Baptists and Bootleggers

- Regulations are often supported by two categories of groups:

- .hi["Baptists"]: group that supports the ostensible public-interest purpose of the regulation

- .hi["Bootleggers"]: group that supports the regulation because it generates rents for them

- Bootleggers often adopt the language of Baptists
