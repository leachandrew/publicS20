# The Two Major Models of Economics as a "Science"

.pull-left[

## Optimization

- Agents have objectives they value

- Agents face constraints

- Make tradeoffs to maximize objectives within constraints

.center[

]
]

.pull-right[

## Equilibrium

- Agents face competition from others that affect prices

- Agents adjust their behaviors based on prices

- Stable outcomes result where all agents cease adjusting

.center[

# Model 1: Optimization

.pull-left[

- .shout[Optimization]: which action(s) best achieve an *objective*? 
    - How long should I keep my old car before buying a new one?
    - Should the U.S. legalize marijuana?
    - Which college courses should I pick?
    - Which political campaign platform will win the most votes?
    - Which path minimizes travel time? 

- Find the *optimum* using .whisper[marginal analysis]

# Model 2: Equilibrium

.pull-left[

- .shout[Equilibrium]: how do stable outcomes emerge in the world (and change)? 
    - Why is there a shortage of affordable housing in big cities?
    - Why is the price of Apple iPhones so high?
    - Why is there only one provider of electricity in a city?
    - Why did the recent election turn out the way it did?

- Find the outcome where *no agents change their behavior* using .whisper[supply and demand]

# Model 3: Game Theory

.pull-left[

- .shout[Game Theory]: what outcome will we *jointly* reach if our choices are **strategic**?
    - Can big companies secretly all raise prices together?
    - Are markets with only a few sellers actually competitive?
    - How can we coordinate our actions to reduce climate change?
    - Why is doping so prevalent in professional sports?

- Find the outcome where *no agents change their behavior* (again, but slightly different!)

# Social Problems that Markets Solve Well 

.pull-left[
- **Problem 1**: Resources have multiple uses and are rivalrous

- **Problem 2**: Different people have different subjective valuations for uses of resources

# Social Problems that Markets Solve Well I

.pull-left[

- .hi[Markets] are institutions that facilitate voluntary *impersonal* exchange and reduce transaction costs

- Prices in a functioning market accurately measure **opportunity cost** of using resources in a particular way
  - The price of a resource is the amount someone else is willing to pay to acquire it from its current use/owner
