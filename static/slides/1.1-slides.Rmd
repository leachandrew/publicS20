# Transaction Costs and Exchange I

.pull-left[
- But .shout[Transaction costs]!
      - **Search costs**: cost of finding trading partners
      - **Bargaining costs**: cost of reaching an agreement
      - **Enforcement costs**: trust between parties, cost of upholding agreement, dealing with unforeseen contingencies, punishing defection, using police and courts

# Transaction Costs and Exchange II

.pull-left[
- With high transaction costs, resources *cannot* be traded

- Resources *cannot* be switched to higher-valued uses

- If others value goods higher than their current owners, resources are *inefficiently* allocated!

# Transaction Costs and Exchange III

.pull-left[
- .shout[Markets] are institutions that facilitate voluntary *impersonal* exchange and reduce transaction costs

- There's a lot of institutions in the "bundle" we call "markets": 
    - Prices, profits and losses, property rights, rule of law, contract enforcement, dispute resolution, protection, trust
    
- All of these things are *assumed* when we draw nice supply & demand graphs on the blackboard
    - Much of this course: how do various *political institutions* enable these market institutions?

# Social Problems that Markets Solve Well 

.pull-left[
- **Problem 1**: Resources have multiple uses and are rivalrous

- **Problem 2**: Different people have different subjective valuations for uses of resources

- **It is inefficient (immoral?) to use a resource in a way that prevents someone else who values it more from using it!**

- .onfire[Problem 2]: Different people have different subjective valuations for uses of resources

- .onfire[It is inefficient (immoral?) to use a resource in a way that prevents someone else who values it more from using it!]

- Solution: Prices in a functioning market accurately measure **opportunity cost** of using resources in a particular way
    - The price of a resource is the amount someone else is willing to pay to acquire it from its current use/owner

# Markets

- .hi[Property rights] provide a pattern of ownership

- .hi[Prices] give us information about how to use scarce resources

- .hi[Profits] incentivize production and .hi[Losses] discipline us

---

# When and Why We Must Choose in Groups

- Property rights & transaction costs

- Externalities

- Public goods

- Collective Action problems

- Justice

---

# But *Groups* Don't Choose

- Methodological individualism

- Society is not an optimization problem

- Individuals have different interests in their different capacities
  - Consumers
  - Producers
  - Voters
  - Interest groups
  - Elected officials
  - Bureaus
