# Externality 

.pull-left[
- The real problem is that it is .hi-purple[external] to the price system!

- People base decisions off of their preferences and opportunity costs of resources for society (captured in prices)

- Prices properly negotiate the opportunity costs and provide information to people 

- But without price, decisions do not .hi-purple[internalize] those effects!

"The traditional approach has tended to obscure the nature of the choice that has to be made. The question is commonly thought of as one in which A inflicts harm on B and what has to be decided is: how should we restrain A? But this is wrong. We are dealing with a problem of a reciprocal nature. To avoid the harm to B would inflict harm on A. The real question that has to be decided is: should A be allowed to harm B or should B be allowed to harm A?" (p.2)

"[Imagine] the case of a confectioner the noise and vibrations from whose machinery disturbed a doctor in his work. To avoid harming the doctor would inflict harmon the confectioner. The problem posed by this case was essentially whether it was worth while, as a result of restricting the methods of production which could be used by the confectioner, to secure more doctoring at the cost of a reduced supply of confectionery products," (p.2).

# Externalities Adjudicated at Law

.pull-left[

- Most externalities in U.S. mediated through common law legal system

- Courts assess how much harm was caused

- Individuals causing harm to others must pay:
    - **compensatory damages** (to redress harms)
    - **punitive damages** (to deter future externalities)
    
- Externalities persist if property rights are *not* clear or are *not* enforced
